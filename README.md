# App-Presentation

Hello again, professor Claudio! 

I hope you liked what you saw. Here I would like to tell you why I chose this platform to present. Although it could be strange to work with a platform whose focus is programming, I think it could be beneficial both for English teachers and students, even if integrated in English teaching. Here are two reasons:

- Powerful tool to create activities. Although learning to code can be hard at the beginning, with a bit of patience and dedication, teachers will count on a great variety of options to create animations and games, such as interactive buttons, stories with different outcomes depending on users' choices, sounds and much more. 

- Programming learning. I strongly believe people who know English has a great advantage at the moment of learning programming over those who don't.  This is due to the fact that almost all the documentation, programs, instructions and commands of the area are written in English. Then, English teachers would boost their learning process and be able to teach programming effectively. On the other hand, students in school may learn English by playing in this platform while they are being exposed to words that are commonly used when developing a project.

If you accept this idea, I would like to ask you what aspect should I focus in.
- Programming basic concepts? (By showing block, their effects and interactions)
- Preparing a fun activity? (Rather presenting an English teaching game)

This is my proposal.

Kind regards.
